#the code is not mine and it was taken from:
#AHMAD AL-KHATEEB https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmadalkhateeb123/easy-simple-87-acc-using-rf##Data-Scalling
#AMIREZZELARAB https://www.kaggle.com/code/amirezzelarab/heart-failure-prediction-data-analysis-and-ml#Classification-Model
#I only did a slight modification
#
#data was obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data
#
#This project explores the use of AI classifiers in detecting heart failures. Random forest and support vector machine are used for this test on data thatâ€™s accessible and inaccessible to #smartwatches and compare the performances. After running the models on the entire dataset, RF got higher accuracy of 89% while SVM scored 84% 
#After dropping features that are inaccessible through smartwatches, the results show RF is more accurate with an accuracy of 80% and SVM got an accuracy of 77%
