#This project explores the use of AI classifiers in detecting heart failures. Random forest and support vector machine are used for this test on data that’s accessible and inaccessible to #smartwatches and compare the performances. After running the models on the entire dataset, RF got higher accuracy of 89% while SVM scored 84% 
#After dropping features that are inaccessible through smartwatches, the results show RF is more accurate with an accuracy of 80% and SVM got an accuracy of 77%
